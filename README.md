# Electrochemical Safety Studies of Cochlear Implant Electrodes Using the Finite Element Method

Hi there,

These are some of the scripts I wrote for the calculations I performed in my thesis. I used MATLAB and COMSOL for a majority of the work. It's all pretty simple, but I guess I uploaded it here for posterity. I'll gradually add more to this repository as I go through all the data. 

Cheers,

Andrian
