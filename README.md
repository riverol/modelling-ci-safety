# Electrochemical Safety Studies of Cochlear Implant Electrodes Using the Finite Element Method

Hi there,

These are some of the scripts I wrote for the calculations I performed in my thesis. I used MATLAB and COMSOL for a majority of the work. It's all pretty simple, but I guess I uploaded it here for posterity. I'll gradually add more to this repository as I go through all the data.

If you want to follow the work here, I recommend you read my <a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au/version/238757086">thesis</a> first 

Cheers,

Andrian
